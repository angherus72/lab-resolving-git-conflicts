My name is Angel Heredia Uscanga
I am an Account Manager
I have previous experience in tech and data some years ago when I took a full stack course, but left it unfortunately

I am here because I really want to learn how to handle data and get conclusions from it
I am in Ironhack because I like the school, the community and the good practices and it looks like a good place to kickstart again my career
I expect to learn enough to make my first analysis of data and to know the path of where to go to in a future become a data scientist

After the bootcamp I expect to begin begin my personal projects of data and switch my career area

I would love my new job to be in the sports area
My future role will look like a person in clients interactions with the background to take data driven decisionsa
My career goal is to be happy with what I do everyday
